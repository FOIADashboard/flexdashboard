# Deportation Research Clinic FOIA Dashboard



## How To Update the Dashboard (Note: Subject to Modification as we transpose fully to Github & Notion)

- Download **R 4.33** and **RStudio**.  
- All raw and intermediate data files should be stored in the Box folder
  - [FOIA Dashboard Box folder](https://app.box.com/s/f4ffqpgph38z530kds6ve2dfyuc0ot1g)
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine (can be done by clicking on green code button top left). Dashboard code and data files are in the `flex_dashboard` folder.
  - Ensure that these files are saved to your **Desktop** (not just the Downloads folder).  
- Locate the file named **FOIAdashboard.Rmd** (inside the `flex_dashboard` folder).  
- Open **FOIAdashboard.Rmd** in RStudio.  
- Further instruction on editing, updating, and publishing the dashboard can be found in the [`flex_dashboard/README.md`](https://github.com/FOIADashboard/flexdashboard/blob/main/flex_dashboard/README.md) file.
